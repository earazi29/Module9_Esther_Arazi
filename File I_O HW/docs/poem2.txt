"The Road Not Taken" By: Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.


"The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost, is my favorite poem because of
the last two lines of the poem, "I took the one less traveled by,/
And that has made all the difference." The poem talks about a person
who is in front of a crossroad in the woods, and instead of taking the
road that everyone takes, he takes the one "less travelled by", showing
that he does not do what everyone else does, rather "walks his own path".
