And that has made all the difference!
Me took the one less traveled by,
Two trails diverged in a wood, and Me--
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Me shall be telling this with a sigh
Me doubted if Me should ever come back!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
Oh, Me kept the first for another day!
Men leaves no step had trodden black!
And both that morning equally lay
Had worn them really about the same,
Though as for that the passing there
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
And having perhaps the better claim,
Then took the other, as just as fair,
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
And looked down one as far as Me could
And be one traveler, long Me stood
And sorry Me could not travel both
Two trails diverged in a yellow wood,
